This is a short test of a DHT11 humidity sensor I had lying around from another project.

This is a low-cost sensor which has a capacitative humidity sensor and the thermistor within the same case. 
I am using the DHT11, which is ultra-low cost, but not very accurate (while the DHT22 is slightly higher cost and has slightly better specifications).
There is a basic analog-to-digital converter within the unit and hence the output is digital. 
The maximum sample rate is once per second.


Adafruit has (as always) a great intro on using these devices:
http://learn.adafruit.com/dht

I used the DHT11 Arduino code from LadyAda website (downloaded about a year ago), from here: http://learn.adafruit.com/dht/downloads.


There are a number of other Arduino libraries for these sensors:

As there is not much info on the sensor itself the pin-out is vital:
From left to right, looking at the sensor from the face with holes in it:
    1 : VCC (5V)
    2 : SIGnal
    3 : NC Not connected
    4 : GND 

I wired the signal pin to D2 on the Arduino and powere dit with 5V (voltage supply range is 3-5.5V, so good for both 3.3V and 5V).

I uploaded the following code:

CODE EXAMPLE

And it started to output data onto the serial interface:

One issue with this is the delay in readings (it took around 2 seconds before a change in humidity was detected). 
It also took a very long time for the humidity values to fall, although this might be how long it takes for humiditiy to drop.


I also had a low-cost DYPTH01B-SPI temperature and humidity sensor module.

Some details on this sensor are available here:

Annoyingly this had output pins which were 2mm pitch, so did not fit into my 2.54mm (0.1") pitch standard breadboard.

There are far fewer examples and libraries for this device, but I did find this weather station design:

This was wired to the SPI lines on the Arduino:

// 10 SS   / CS
// 11 MOSI / nc
// 12 MISO / SDAT
// 13 CLK  / SCK

// 5V      / VDD
// GND     / VSS
// nc      / Reset


There was a solder bridge over one of the capacitors (which was missing). When I looked at anothe runit I had - it had a 0ohm resistor in that posiion, so it is meant to be connected...
