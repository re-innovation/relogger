# Renewable Energy Data Logger
A multi-function renewable energy data-logger for remote logging.
This is an Arduino-based data-logger desinged to have reasanable accuracy, be low-cost, suitable for use in remote areas and to be user-friendly to set-up and use.

This is based upon work with Wind Empowerment.

This repository contains:
* An overview of the project and functions
* The Schematics and PCB design files (KiCAD)
* The Arduino control code and associated libraries
* Datasheets for all the components
* Instructions for use
